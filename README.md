### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹


This is Soujanya S R, currently a research scholar in Digital VLSI at IIIT-Banaglore. Here's a brief introduction about my interest and my work so far!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working in the areas of hardware accelerators for neural networks and exploiting the advantages of approximate computing in the same
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to implement a CNN based medical signal classification problem on FPGA using Vitis HLS
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on works that are emerging in the field of Digital VLSI and Embedded Systems

- I'm Also interested in exploring different types of Processors. Worked on RISC-V based Out-of-order Tomasulo https://github.com/SoujanyaSR/Tomasulo-Out-of-order-Processor
  and In-order Vector processor https://github.com/SoujanyaSR/Vector-processor
